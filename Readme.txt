README for Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard Project
Project Overview
This project involves developing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for analyzing and optimizing emergency room operations 
in a hospital setting. The dashboard aims to provide actionable insights to enhance operational efficiency, improve patient care, 
and inform decision-making.

Steps in Project Development
Requirement Gathering: Understand the key business requirements from stakeholders.
Data Walkthrough: Review the available data to align with project goals.
Data Connection: Establish secure and reliable connections to the data sources.
Data Cleaning & Quality Check: Perform preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and verifying data integrity.
Data Modeling: Structure the data to support analytical queries and dashboard functionality.
Data Processing: Apply necessary transformations and aggregations.
DAX Calculations: Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating calculated fields and measures.
Dashboard Layout & Chart Development: Design user-friendly layouts and create visualizations, including sparklines, bar charts, and grids.
Insights Generation: Interpret visualized data to produce actionable recommendations.


Dashboards Developed
Monthly View: Focuses on month-by-month trends such as admission rates, age distribution, and wait times.
Consolidated View: Provides a holistic summary of key metrics for a specified date range.
Patient Details: Enables detailed analysis of patient-level data for troubleshooting and personalized care.

KPIs Addressed
Number of Patients: Analyze daily ER visit trends.
Average Wait Time: Monitor efficiency in patient service.
Patient Satisfaction Score: Measure and improve service quality.
Number of Patients Referred: Identify departments with high referral rates.

Terminology
Key Data Fields
Patient ID: Unique alphanumeric identifier for each patient.
Patient Admission Date: Timestamp of the patientâ€™s entry into the ER.
Patient First Initial: Used for anonymization while maintaining data utility.
Patient Last Name: May be anonymized but valuable for identifying familial patterns.
Patient Gender: Recorded as Male, Female, or Nonbinary for demographic analysis.
Patient Age: Helps in age-specific trend identification and care optimization.
Patient Race: Essential for analyzing disparities in healthcare access and outcomes.
Department Referral: Tracks the department where a patient was referred, e.g., Cardiology or Orthopedics.
Patient Admin Flag: Indicates whether a patient was admitted for further care (True/False).
Patient Satisfaction Score: Evaluates ER service quality, measured on a defined scale.
Patient Wait Time: Duration from arrival to initial medical attention.
Case Manager (CM): Coordinates patient care, ensuring efficient service and documentation.

Analysis Objectives
Monitor trends and patterns across patient demographics.
Assess operational challenges such as peak times and resource allocation.
Identify areas for improvement in service quality and patient satisfaction.
Provide granular data for troubleshooting and strategic decision-making.
